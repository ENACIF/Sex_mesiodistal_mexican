**Abstract**

> ##### Sex diagnosis by teeth is challenging in forensic cases in Mexico; it must involve the collaboration of experts to assist in the reconstructive identification process in cases where only dental evidence is available. Through a multidisciplinary approach (odontology, anthropology, and statistics), this study aims to analyze the reliability of mesiodistal (MD) distance in vestibular view at the incisal third in permanent canines from dental models with known data to generate a specific reference in the diagnosis sex for the Mexican population. Intra and interobserver tests of the measures recorded by four observers were used. Additionally, parametric statistical methods (descriptive statistics, confidence intervals, and logistic regression models) were employed to identify the relationship between distance and sex differences. The analysis demonstrated more significant dimorphism in the left maxillary and left and right mandibular canines, and results showed a 95% confidence interval; it was determined for the MD distances. Our study generates another tool to guide how to help discrimination between females and males (biological sex) in reconstructing the Mexican population's biological profile. This article proposes multidisciplinary forensic practice without the borders and delimited scope of each area; the identification of people in Mexico is a national problem that requires joint disciplines or team collaboration.
